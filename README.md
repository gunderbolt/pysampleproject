# Example Package

This is a simple example package. You can use
[Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
to write your content.

# Tutorial

I followed the [Packaging Projects tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects)
to create this package. I've made small changes to make sure things were working
correctly and added `bump2version` support.

# Development

This package has the following dependencies for development:

```
setuptools
build
twine
bump2version
```

bump2version can easily bump the `major`, `minor` and `patch` version numbers prior to building the software.
